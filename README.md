Insted of using a well defined message Broker like Rabbit MQ or messeage queuues, I have used REDIS and a npm library named Bull which uses redis. 

1.  install and run redis run locally:
2.  Run Redis Commander here https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis-commander  (This GUI tool helps to check what keys are being sent on Redis.)
3.  run npm install and npm start to run the server
